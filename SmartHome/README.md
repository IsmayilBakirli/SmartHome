# SmartHome API

The SmartHome API allows users to manage smart home automation devices and access sensor data associated with them. The API facilitates operations such as adding, updating, 
deleting, assigning devices, and monitoring sensor data. The DevicesController handles all operations related to managing and interacting with these devices. 
It enables users to add, remove, and update devices, assign them to specific users, and track sensor readings.

## üìò Overview

The SmartHome system provides:
- Device and  management
- Sensor data tracking
- Role-based access (Admin, Host, Member)
- Energy consumption and health analytics
- Location and category control

---

## üîê Authentication

The API uses **JWT Token Authentication**.  
- s must first authenticate via the `POST /api/s/login` endpoint.
- Upon successful login, a JWT token is returned.
- This token must be included in the `Authorization` header as:  
  `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
