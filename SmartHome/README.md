# üöÄ SmartHome API Documentation

The **SmartHome API** is a secure, modular and role-driven backend designed for managing smart home automation devices, their sensor data, and user-role interactions.
It supports multi-tenant management through structured roles (Admin, Host, Member) and provides analytics for monitoring usage and health.

## üìò Overview

The **SmartHome API** enables:

* Smart device management (add, update, assign, monitor)
* Sensor data collection and visualization
* Hierarchical role-based access control
* Physical location and category-based device grouping
* Energy and health analytics per device/location

---

## üß± Architecture & Design

### ‚úÖ Clean Layered Architecture

* **Controller Layer** ‚Äì Handles HTTP requests/responses
* **Service Layer** ‚Äì Contains business logic and role validations
* **Repository Layer** ‚Äì Handles data access (via EF Core)
* **Entities & DTOs** ‚Äì Clear separation of concerns with AutoMapper

### üîê Role-Based Ownership Hierarchy

| Role   | Manages          | Description                                                     |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin  | Hosts, Devices   | Can create Hosts and assign devices                             |
| Host   | Members, Devices | Can create Members, manage and assign devices to them           |
| Member | Their devices    | Can only view (or update if ReadWrite) devices assigned to them |

---

### üß© Device Model Breakdown

The device-related data is structured into three abstraction layers for scalability:

1. **DeviceCategory**: Shared template-level configuration (e.g. Smart Bulb)
2. **Device**: Individual physical device, tied to user/location
3. **Location**: Physical grouping of devices (e.g. ‚ÄúKitchen‚Äù)

```plaintext
DeviceCategory ‚Üí Device ‚Üí Location (1:N relationships)
```

This structure ensures:
‚úÖ Reusability
‚úÖ No data duplication
‚úÖ Logical ownership per role
‚úÖ Real-world device representation

---

## üîê Authentication

* Based on **JWT Token Authentication**
* All requests (except login) must include:

```http
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

* Users authenticate via `POST /api/users/login`

## üß© Controllers

### üë§ UsersController

Handles authentication and role-based user creation.

| Endpoint                   | Method | Description                 | Roles       |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| `/api/users/login`         | POST   | Login and receive JWT token | Public      |
| `/api/users/create-host`   | POST   | Create a Host               | Admin       |
| `/api/users/create-member` | POST   | Create a Member             | Admin, Host |
| `/api/users/all`           | GET    | List users filtered by role | Admin, Host |

**Design Notes**:

* Each user is linked to the creator (OwnerId)
* Role hierarchy enforces who can create or see whom

---
